    * Enforces max duration = 24h
    * Enforces vehicle number format (`XX00XX0000`, e.g., `KA05MH1234`)
  * `GET /availability` â†’ List available slots for a given time range

    * Supports **pagination & sorting**
  * `GET /reservations/{id}` â†’ Fetch reservation details

* **Optimistic Locking**: Protects against concurrent booking conflicts
* **Validation & Global Exception Handling**
* **Interactive API docs** via Swagger UI

## Tech Stack

* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot 3**
* **Spring Data JPA + Hibernate**
* **H2 Database** (in-memory, dev)
* **Jakarta Validation** (`@Valid`, constraints)
* **Lombok** (for boilerplate reduction)
* **Springdoc OpenAPI** (Swagger UI) // Still being implemented.

## Setup & Run

### 1. Clone repository after forking

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-lot-reservation.git
cd parking-lot-reservation
```

### 2. Build project

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### 3. Run application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

By default, the app runs at:
ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

## Database

* Uses **H2 in-memory DB**
* Access H2 console at:
  ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
* Default JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:parkingdb`
* Username: `sa`
* Password: *(empty)*

## Note to Evaluators

I would like to clarify that I am not a primary Spring Boot developer. Due to time constraints, I had only around 3 hours to complete this assignment. While the core logic and approach are my own, I relied on ChatGPT for assistance with several aspects of the implementation, given my limited experience with Spring Boot.

My primary expertise lies in **Node.js** development, and because of my limited familiarity with Spring Boot, I had to depend on AI support to bridge the gaps. I request that this context be considered during the evaluation process to ensure a fair and transparent assessment of my work.
